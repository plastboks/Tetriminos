Tetriminos
==========
Tetriminos is a small C and ncurses implementation of the Tetris game.

About
=====
This small game gets a lot of inspiration from the Ctris game at http://www.hackl.dhs.org/ctris/.
Tetriminos will try to stay as true to the original game as possible (meaning Alexey Pajitnovs 1984 Tetris).
